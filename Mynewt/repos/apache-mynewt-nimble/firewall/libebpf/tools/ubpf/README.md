Because the in-kernel eBPF implementation is licensed under GPLv2, it cannot be easily redistributed by non-GPL users so there is also an alternative Apache-licensed userspace eBPF VM implementation called "uBPF". Legalese aside, this userspace implementation can probably be useful for tracing performance-critical applications which need to avoid the cost of kernel-userspace context switches.
